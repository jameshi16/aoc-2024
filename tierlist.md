## Day 1

Would be great if I had a programming language.

Did it in excel.

## Day 2

Some of chat still had code that produced bad solutions.

Quite difficult to track down.

Bruteforce saved the day tho.

## Day 3

Used cyberchef, I'm so happy

## Day 4

Really really boring, tedious

## Day 5

Really nice, if part 1 was done with a comparison function, part 2 was basically a generalization

## Day 6

I hate pathfinding

Attempted to get the solution with Google Sheets manually, but was off by /2

(Incomplete)

## Day 7

Tried scratch, gave up.

## Day 8

Reading comprehension issues

## Day 9

Just a skill issue: 7/10

## Day 10

8/10
